Mark 4/16/17 - 	I added this StudentUI folder to hold the studentchat.css. I took the orange color straight from the UTSA website. The studentchat.html file is just a driver to testing the layout and colors, and the student.js file is a copy of the botchat.js edited to display the "OIT Connect... " label. I dont like that the title is burried in this fule, but it works for now.

I think we just need to include this .css in the default chatbot page that has been published on our remote server and the .css should work.
